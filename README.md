# web-developer-bootcamp-exercises

The files located herein are solely for the purpose of documenting my path through Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp found on Udacity. The files are sorted into their respective folders, and were named as determined by me, not necessarily as the course dictated. If you are taking the same course, please feel free to check my solutions against your own, or use the included images and files as inspiration for your own exercises.

Note: you will gain the most benefit from typing out each word, punctuation, and syntax rather than copying and pasting lines of code. For example, if you want to become skilled at playing baseball, it makes more sense to actually play the game rather than watch someone else.
